Debug Code functions

These functions are named functions explicitly avalible and compiled for devs to use during runtime of a specific view.

These functions are tied to a view pointer, and will be avalible when that view pointer is currently the most active view.

Functions are registered with a `_register_debug_function()` call, which takes in a name (string), view (usually `this`), and a callback (MX::Safecallback<>).

The name will be the title when displayed in the list.
The view will be used to organize which functions will be avalible at any given time
The callback will be the actual code run when it is selected.


Branch:
A. The view stores each callback it has avalible to it in a devtool wrapped field/function set.
  How does the bottom sheet know which view to pull from?
    On view became active, we could just set a global static var to point to that views list. That seems cool.
B. All debug callbacks are stored in one location with their view pointers for keys.
